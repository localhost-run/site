localhost.run offers a forever free plan that not only doesn't require a client download, it doesn't even require signup for short-lived tunnels.

Follow along with [The Basics](the-basics.md) and you'll be up and running in no time.

There are some limitations on the free domains tho:

1. Domain names change regularly.
1. There is a speed limit.

These limits are in place to prevent phishing sites from establishing themselves on localhost.run domains.

These limits are not in place on the Custom Domain plans, so if you need a stable domain name with faster transfer rates please consider signing up for one at https://admin.localhost.run.

## Give your free domain a longer life

If you use a free domain but want the domain name to last longer sign-up at https://admin.localhost.run/ and [add your SSH key](faq.md#generating-an-ssh-key).
